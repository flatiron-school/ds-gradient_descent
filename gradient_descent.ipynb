    "## The Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent** is an optimization procedure that, in one form or another, underlies many model-fitting algorithms. The gradient, in concept, is a generalized notion of a derivative and so belongs to **calculus** (or **analysis**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(x_1, ... , x_n)$ is a function of $n$ variables, then its gradient is equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large\\nabla f(x_1, ... , x_n) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}\\hat{x_1} + ... + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}\\hat{x_n}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{x_k}$ is the unit vector in the $\\vec{x_k}$-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that, in the single-variable case, a positive derivative indicates an increasing function and a negative derivative indicates a decreasing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multivariate case, the gradient tells us how the function is changing **in each dimension**. A large value of the derivative with respect to a particular variable means that the gradient will have a large component in the corresponding direction. Therefore, **the gradient will point in the direction of steepest increase**."

    "## Loss Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already encountered the notion of a loss function. For an ordinary least-squares regression, the typical loss function is simply the sum of squared differences between the true $y$-values and the corresponding values on the best-fit line. And the goal, of course, is to **minimize** our loss function. (This is not of course to say that we can make it negligibly small or zero; the nature of the data and the nature of the model will impose restrictions on how much progress we can make.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea we take from calculus here is that **the minimum of the loss function must occur where its slope is zero**. To calculate, analytically, the parameters of the best-fit line, we construct the derivative of the least-squares function with respect to the parameters of the line (slope and y-intercept) and then set the resulting expressions to zero, solving for the parameters."

    "(1, 2), (3, 9), (5, 10),\n",
    "\n",
    "and that we're interested in constructing a best-fit line through them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this optimization problem has a well-known solution and we could simply plug in our values here into that formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to a linear regression problem is a matter of minimizing the sum of squared distances between actual y-values and the line's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, model optimization involves setting the derivative of the function you want to minimize (for a linear regression, this would be the sum of the squared distances between $y$ and $\\hat{y}$) to zero, and then solving for the parameters that define the model (for a linear regression, this would be the slope and y-intercept).\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not always easily or efficiently done. Sometimes the loss function is quite complicated and it is not a straightforward matter to set the derivative equal to zero and to solve the resulting equation(s) for the missing parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's easier or more efficient to use gradient descent.\n",

    "- make a guess at where the function attains its minimum value; and then\n",
    "- calculate the derivative at that point; and then\n",
    "- use that value to decide how to make your next guess!\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat until we get the derivative as close as we like to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to improve our guess at the minimum of our loss function, we'll move in the **opposite direction** of the gradient away from our last guess. Hence we are using the *gradient* of our loss function to *descend* to the minimum value of the relevant loss function.\n",
